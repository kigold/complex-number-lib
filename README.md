#Complex Number Library
This Library is basically a class that models the concept of complex number
  as seen in the fields of Mathematics, Engineering Accounting and the likes.
  In summary, this complex number phenomenon caters for a set of number that 
  cannot be accounted for by the number line, the number line on which you can 
  define numbers such as ;
  *Numbers greater than Zero to the right of zero (Positive Numbers)*
  *Numbers less than Zero to the left of zero (Negative Numbers)*
  *and Zero ('the Yard Stick')*
  in brief, the square root of minus one (-1) was not accommodated by this system, it seemed to be on another axis entirly. [read more on wiki] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number).
  This class implements an instance of this complex number, and provides basic mathematical operations on it;
  *Addition*
  *Subtraction*
  *Multiplication*
  *and Division*

###Getting Started
This Library comes in a mathx package, it can be downloaded by cloning this repository.
This project can be useful in different ways
Note: To utilise the Console User Interface node.js is required

###Prerequesites
```
Node.js
npm
```

###Installation
Node.js and npm are required to use the Console User Interface, follow these steps:
*1. Clone this repository*
*2. cd into the repository directory*
*3. ```npm install -g ```
*4. When the installation of dependecies are complete type ``` node complex```*
*5 follow the prompt*

To use without node:
*1. Clone this repository*
*2. copy the complex.js file from the ``` ./bin/complex.js ``` into any directory you need it*
*3. if it is a web based project, just include the script tag*
```html
<script src="complex.js"></script>
```

To add to another project in node:
*1. Clone this repository*
*2. locate the ```./bin/complex.js```*
*3. copy the complex.js file to a directory in your project that you are convinient with*
*4. In the project file you need the Class, type*
```javascript
var Complex = require('./complex')
```
*5. Insert the correct directory path depending on where you copy the file*

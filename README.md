#Complex Number Library
This Library is basically a class that models the concept of complex number
  as seen in the fields of Mathematics, Engineering Accounting and the likes.
  In summary, this complex number phenomenon caters for a set of number that 
  cannot be accounted for by the number line, the number line on which you can 
  define numbers such as ;
  *Numbers greater than Zero to the right of zero (Positive Numbers)*
  *Numbers less than Zero to the left of zero (Negative Numbers)*
  *and Zero ('the Yard Stick')*
  in brief, the square root of minus one (-1) was not accommodated by this system, it seemed to be on another axis entirly. [read more on wiki] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number).
  This class implements an instance of this complex number, and provides basic mathematical operations on it;
  *Addition*
  *Subtraction*
  *Multiplication*
  *and Division*
